# Nodejs boilerplates the easy way

---

If you ended here is because you had the same problem than me, use boilerplates that just are not working as expected, with multiple configuration requirements, and mismatching packages.

I've created this to solve that, you have the bare minimum and you only need pnpm, yarn, npm or the package manager you want, run the install, and start the project, that't it, all the promised functionality will work.

## Included boilerplates

---

As each project may need different stuff, there is a bunch of boilerplates, with their own readme and the list of what it does, so you can find the exact minimum you want, and in 2 minutes have it up and coding ;)

### Node-TS: 
    - nodejs
    - typescript (import ~~require~~)


### Node-TS-Jest:
    - nodejs
    - typescript (import ~~require~~)
    - jest (ts and js)

### Node-TS-Jest-express:
    - nodejs
    - typescript (import ~~require~~)
    - jest (ts and js)
    - express


## Collaboration or problems?

---

If you want to collaborate just send a PR with your fix/changes/additions, so everybody can get advantage of the simplest configs to use and we can have them organized here.

If you are aiming for something specific that does not fit in the ones in the list, leave a ticket so we can create it.

In case you were not able to just run install and start to make it work, please open a ticket with as much information as possible so i will take a look.
